## ðŸŽ“ **Minerva University Journey**

From 2020 to 2024, I completed the following Computer Science courses in chronological order (excluding Business courses), achieving a GPA of 3.68/4.00:

1. **CS50-51: Formal Analyses**
2. **CS110: Problem Solving with Data Structures and Algorithms**
3. **CS111: Single and Multivariable Calculus**
4. **CS113: Theory and Applications of Linear Algebra**
5. **CS114: Probability, Statistics, and the Structure of Randomness**
6. **CS164: Optimization Methods**
7. **CS166: Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems**
8. **CS162: Software Development: Building Powerful Applications**
9. **CS130: Statistical Modeling: Prediction and Causal Inference**
10. **IL181: AI Ethics and Social Justice**

During these courses, I undertook 250 lectures, and wrote 65+ assignments (from case studies to oral interviews), honing my skills in logical thinking, statistical inference, and algorithms and simulation.

In 2025, I enhanced my knowledge through the following two courses:

1. **IBM Generative AI Engineering Professional Certificate by IBM using Coursera provided by Tent Mentorship Program**
2. **Machine Learning Specialization Certificate by Stanford and DeepLearning.ai**

Over the past three years, I have been consistently mentored by technical leaders from Microsoft, Google, Etsy, TikTok, and Amazon. They have helped me bridge my theoretical knowledge with real-life cases.

## ðŸš€ **Career Path**

Venturing into the professional world, I gravitated towards **Product Management**, gaining experience at renowned places such as:

- **FreedomCode**

The freedomcode.org website uses React, MongoDB, and Next.js to create a dynamic and responsive interface that works on any device. React is a JavaScript library that allows you to create interactive components such as buttons, forms, menus, etc. MongoDB is a database that stores information about users, messages, projects, etc. Next.js is a framework that helps developers easily build websites with React.

The freedomcode.org site also uses additional front-end features such as Emotion, Three.js, and MUI. Emotion is a library that allows you to style React components using CSS. Three.js is a library that allows you to create 3D graphics on web pages. MUI is a library that provides ready-made components for creating a beautiful and user-friendly design.

The architecture of the freedomcode.org website is based on the Rest API. This means that the website communicates with the server using requests and responses in JSON format. JSON is a way of representing data in the form of key-value pairs. This method allows you to easily exchange data between different programming languages and platforms.

- **Astria Learning**

I also explored the realms of research, journalism, and course development, contributing to:

- **Curriculum Developer for AI Ethics & Social Justice 4 Credits Course at Minerva University**: Co-created a syllabus for undergraduate seniors, integrated feedback from Microsoftâ€™s Responsible AI Director and NVIDIAâ€™s CTO. Please, access [here]([(https://spurious-plot-44a.notion.site/AI-Ethics-Social-Justice-Course-1a1a7ec29b388057953dce5a5a174d0e]).
- **Co-Author of Research on AI-Based Skincare at European Alliance for Technology Development**: Analyzed 150+ AI-driven skincare projects; spotted validated tech vs. hype, revealing telemedicine gaps for rural areas.
- **East-West Digital News**: Served as a journalist covering innovations in the energy sector.
- **Inc. Magazine**: Developed a course on Data Analytics, merging my knowledge of computer science with educational expertise.

## ðŸŒŸ **Early Achievements**

### **Dnipro Lyceum of Information Technologies (2017-2019)**
My journey began here, diving deep into:
- **C# and Visual Studio**: Where I grasped the concepts of OOP.
- **Web and Graphic Design**: Mastering tools like SketchUp and GIMP.
- **Projects**:
  - [First Website](https://kseniamaslakova.github.io/)
  - [Astronomy Class Web App](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yr_4HooHum3bWH7GK5ok7M68SKLUZXXH)
- **Achievement**: Secured the **2nd place** in a national web design competition.

### **[Decided.org.ua](https://decided.org.ua/)**
Post-lyceum, I co-created this platform, taking charge of:
- Building the website.
- Developing a telegram bot.
- Initiating a mobile app project (in progress).

## **Looking Ahead**

As I forge ahead, I am eager to leverage my rich educational background and diverse professional experience to make significant contributions to the tech landscape. I am open to collaborations and discussions, aiming to create something remarkable and innovative.
